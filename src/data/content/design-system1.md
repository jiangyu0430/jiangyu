### **📌 Guide:**

A design system may sound like a big concept, but its true value has never been about “standards”—it’s about solving chaos. It’s not just a designer’s concern, but an organizational one. In this article, we’ll start from real collaboration issues to understand why design systems emerge, what problems they solve, and how they should be tailored to the organization.

## **I. "Current Situation" Unveiling the Mask of Design Out of Control**

### 1.1 The Most Fatal Problems Are the Invisible Ones

You take over a B-end project, and on the first day you open the design files, something feels off. Colors are inconsistent, button styles are all over the place, and even the same modal looks completely different on different pages. Strangely, these “weird” designs aren’t bugs—they’re history. You check the files, look up documentation, ask around, and the answers are always: “That’s how it was done before,” “We were in a rush,” “That was added temporarily.” Every bit of chaos has its origin.

This isn’t a one-off design mistake, but a systemic defect accumulated over time from countless uncoordinated decisions. Some see it as “no standards,” but the real issue is that no one is truly responsible for the “system.” You think it’s just inconsistent styles or scattered components, but when you try to upgrade the experience or change features, you find the product is shackled by invisible chains. You’re no longer a designer—you’re fighting history.

This is the first crack of design out of control: beneath surface chaos lies deep disorder.

### 1.2 Collaboration Isn’t a “Process Issue”—It’s a Language Issue

Designers talk about “consistency,” developers care about “code structure,” and product managers want things “done quickly.” Everyone does their part, but no one can articulate the “system as a whole.” You often encounter conversations like:

> Product: Can we reuse the previous page?  
> Designer: Not exactly the same, but not totally different either.  
> Developer: Can you clarify—reuse or not?

It’s not anyone’s fault—the team lacks a shared “collaboration language.” The process is followed, designs are done, code is written, but the information chain is broken, the experience is fragmented, and collaboration is hard to form.

This invisible language barrier causes everyone to talk past each other, increasing communication costs and misunderstandings. Process closure is only superficial; true collaboration is built on a shared language.

### 1.3 Complexity Makes Loss of Control More “Hidden”

B-end products are especially prone to “system out of control” traps. They are inherently complex:

- Dense features, each involving multiple business groups;
- Diverse user roles, with different permissions and paths;
- Multi-end linkage, multi-language adaptation, and endless configuration needs;
- Meanwhile, product pace is under constant pressure for “fast launch” and “efficient delivery.”

So, many teams stop “building” and start “making do”—copy-paste pages, use whatever component works, tweak styles on the fly, and documentation is neglected. Over time, your system still works, but has lost its self-healing ability. Every early “temporary” style may become untouchable debt later.

Designers become “temporary fixers,” product managers become “component schedulers,” and developers are exhausted switching between incompatibilities. Everyone seems busy, but the system is quietly sinking.

### 1.4 It’s Not a Lack of Standards, But a Lack of “System”

You might think the solution is a new component library or another set of standards documentation. But experience tells us: that’s not enough. What truly stabilizes a system is not better files, but a clearer system—a structural system that everyone can understand, use, maintain, and give feedback on. It’s not to make designers’ lives easier, but to give the whole team a shared language and resilience to change.

A design system is not a UI project—it’s an operating system for the team. It doesn’t just serve current design goals, but supports future evolution. You think you’re “unifying styles,” but you’re actually building a defense against chaos for the organization.

If you’ve experienced those “everything feels off” projects, those “no one can explain why it’s like this” page structures, or those “use-and-forget” component libraries, then you already know:

**It’s not that we’re not trying—it’s that we lack a system.**

## **II. "Cognition" Understanding the Essence of Design Systems**

### **2.1 Starting from “Let’s Unify”: Everyone Wants It, But It’s Always Hard to Achieve**

You’ve surely heard this in projects—“Should we unify this?” It sounds gentle, like a suggestion, but often hides a sense of fatigue—a subtle feeling of finally deciding to “fix things” after struggling in chaos for a long time.

But unify what? Colors? Component structure? Interaction patterns? Everyone has their own answer, but they’re not the same. Worse, after every “unification,” the problems always come back: someone creates a new component, someone secretly changes styles, someone doesn’t even know the standards exist.

You realize it’s not about effort, but the lack of a **systematic method** understood, used, and maintained by everyone. Everyone wants unification, but it never happens—unification becomes a “periodic illusion”: each round seems to integrate things, but only temporarily suppresses the chaos, which flares up again at the slightest breeze.

**A design system** is born to break this cycle of “everyone wants unification, but always fails.” It’s not a standard made up by a designer, nor a document no one reads—it’s a **structural method that the whole team can operate**. It lets “unification” finally move from “manual maintenance” to “mechanism-driven routine.” It’s not about “making a page look good,” but answering—**how can we sustainably, collaboratively, and at scale, do good design.**

### **2.2 Design System vs. Design Framework: From Tools to Collaboration Mechanisms**

“Design system” and “design framework” are often confused, even within teams. Some think they’re just different terms; others think a design system is just a component library, and a framework is an empty shell. But the difference is not just in naming—it’s a **division of thinking levels**.

A **design system** is more about “assets.” It’s the visible, usable set: colors, fonts, spacing, icons, base components, documentation, standards. It solves: how do we keep design language consistent, implement UI standards in code, and improve reuse and delivery efficiency. Think of it as an engine—compact, reliable, and once started, it outputs power steadily. But with just an engine, a car won’t go far.

A **design framework**? It’s the logic of the whole car. You need the engine, but also the steering wheel, brakes, dashboard, transmission, and you need to know the driving rules, maintenance system, inspection process, driver training... That’s the complete “framework.”

In other words, a design system solves “how do we quickly make consistent interfaces,” while a design framework focuses on “how do we, as an organization, create experience value collaboratively and over the long term.”

It cares not just about “how to design,” but also **why design this way, who drives it, how to govern, how to evolve**. It’s an organizational capability—turning “design” from individual intuition into a system asset.

So, the design system is the engine you use; the framework is the whole operating system.

### **2.3 For Sustainable Good Experience, Not Just One-Off Visual Unification**

Many teams pushing design systems are misunderstood as just “making the interface prettier” or “making development easier.” But if a system’s value is only in “looking neat,” it will soon be replaced, abandoned, or forgotten. Truly excellent design systems are never just for “looking good”—their goal is to **make ‘good’ sustainable**.

A perfectly designed page only matters “here and now.” But if you want that experience to **persist in future versions, collaborate across products, and be shared among roles**, you need a system.

- On the **collaboration dimension**, it provides a common language so product, design, and development are on the same page;
- On the **design dimension**, it creates inheritable logic, so style and behavior are consistent, not just personal habit;
- On the **development dimension**, it provides clear contracts for efficient implementation;
- On the **product dimension**, it lowers maintenance costs and reduces system risk from “patchwork” updates.

You think you’re building a standard, but you’re actually building an **organizational user experience capability**. The design system is the visible part; the framework is the “operating core” that enables the whole experience system to evolve.

It’s not about controlling creativity, but **supporting what truly matters, so it lasts longer.**

If you’ve been stuck in the “can’t unify” cycle, seen standards become shelfware, or struggled with language barriers in collaboration, you already know: a design system isn’t just adding a process—it’s finally being able to do good experience without relying on individual heroics.

## **III. "Path" How Design Systems Evolve with Products**

When discussing design system building, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking there’s a standard answer—just copy a big company’s template and you’ll have a system. But in reality, every team’s stage, resources, and goals are different. Whether a system works depends on whether it matches the **product’s lifecycle**.

Just as products evolve from 0 to 1, from trial and error to growth, from local to platform, design systems can’t be built overnight. They need to grow with the product, from “lightweight standards” to “mechanism building,” and gradually establish scalable, collaborative, and governable system capabilities.

If you talk about systems without considering product pace, you’ll fall into two traps: either “doing too much too soon,” making the system useless, or “never starting,” until design debt is unmanageable. The real questions are never “should we build a system,” but:

> “What stage are we at now?”  
> “At this stage, what kind of system is ‘just right’?”

### **3.1 Startup Phase: Laying the Minimal Foundation from 0 to 1**

At the product’s start, everything is about “launching.” The team is small, roles are blurred, designers may also do product work; consistency isn’t the top priority—design intuition rules, and many components are “copy-pasted.”

This is also a phase of rapid trial and error: requirements change weekly, page structures aren’t stable, and all effort is on “getting it running.” At this point, a system seems distant, even a “waste of time.” But if we shift perspective—not aiming for full standards, but **planting seeds of order**—the system will take root more easily later.

We see that mature systems often didn’t start with a big investment, but with one or a few people making minimal but key records amid chaos, like—which colors are shared? What button variants exist? Can component naming be unified?

These aren’t “standards,” but **anchors to reduce future repetitive work**.

Startup phase system building advice:

- No need for a full system, but define basic colors and button styles, and keep them in Figma Variables or naming conventions;
- Keep component naming consistent—even if copy-pasted, don’t let naming structure fall apart;
- Clarify a “decision maker” mechanism—even if it’s just you, know who decides on a component;
- Maintain a habit of documentation—even if there’s no platform, write change reasons next to the design.

The startup phase system isn’t to control collaboration, but to **save your future self time fixing things**.

### **3.2 Growth Phase: Chaos Emerges—The Best Time for System Building**

As the product enters the growth phase, the biggest change isn’t more features, but **more people involved**. Designers are no longer solo, product lines expand, modules are reused; meanwhile, experience fragmentation surfaces.

You’ll start hearing:

> “Why do these two cards look different?”  
> “This button isn’t the same as that module’s—was it missed?”  
> “Can I just change this component?”

Many teams first realize at this stage—**systems aren’t for aesthetics, but to avoid collaboration waste**. The essence is to build a structure for sustainable reuse and maintenance.

At this stage, the focus shifts from “are there standards” to “can components be efficiently reused by many.” “Reuse” depends on unified naming, state definitions, versioning, and most importantly: a **structure with minimal constraints on assets**.

Growth phase system building advice:

- Build a reusable component asset library and usage documentation;
- Establish unified component naming, categorization, and state rules to avoid personal interpretation;
- Introduce “component versioning” so components can evolve without affecting what’s live;
- Clarify “design owner” roles—component updates need review or consensus;
- Don’t aim for “100% unification,” but ensure design differences are “intentional and reasoned,” not accidental.

The growth phase is the best window for systems to “grow.” Chaos is visible, the team is willing to co-build, and with the first layer of structure, the system can handle more collaboration pressure.

### **3.3 Maturity Phase: The System Becomes an Efficiency Platform**

In mature products, the business model is stable, and the design team is integral to the product chain. Now, the challenge shifts from “components look the same” to “can collaboration run smoothly” and “can the system evolve itself.”

You’ll face questions like:

- Who manages and unifies cross-end component differences?
- With multiple designers maintaining the system, how do you know what’s consensus and what’s an exception?
- Many page styles follow standards, but results are still inconsistent—where’s the problem?

At this stage, the system is no longer just a list of standards, but an **organic system of structure + tools + mechanisms**. Design language, component library, design tokens, version control, and collaboration processes all work together. The system moves from “document management” to platformized, structured support.

Maturity phase system building advice:

- Build a multi-layer structure of “component system + token system + multi-end adaptation” to support flexible reuse of complex modules;
- Integrate Figma Library, component platform, code platform, etc., for unified asset management;
- Introduce design version management—every change is traceable, reviewable, and alertable;
- Abstract design patterns, distill cross-scenario interaction and structure solutions for stable reuse in complex tasks;
- Use platform analytics to track component usage, redundancy, etc., to inform governance and evolution.

The mature system is essentially **organizational-level collaboration infrastructure**. It not only boosts design efficiency, but also supports cross-functional collaboration, quality assessment, and version evolution—foundational for moving from “stable output” to “systematic efficiency.”

A design system is not a one-off asset, but a **system capability that evolves with the product**. Each stage doesn’t need the “perfect system,” just the “most suitable system”:

- In the **startup phase**, the system is minimal restraint on chaos—a seed of order;
- In the **growth phase**, the system is the skeleton for reuse and collaboration—a support structure for co-building;
- In the **maturity phase**, the system is an efficiency amplifier—a foundation for cross-functional collaboration.

Understand your stage, build the “just right”
